# print-form

This is an easy to use web server with the intention of easily enabling users to upload files for them to request to be printed. Handy for homelab college students that also happen to have a printer in their room that they want to share. Currently featuring password protection to avoid spam and an admin interface portal for managing submissions and archiving them.
